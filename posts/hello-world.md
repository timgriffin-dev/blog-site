# Welcome to My Dev Blog!

Hey there! I'm Tim, a software engineer who's passionate about building things and sharing knowledge. After months of thinking about it, I finally built this blog and here we are!

## What You'll Find Here

This blog will cover:

- **Personal Projects**: I'm diving into the micro-SaaS world and want to share what I build
- **Work Learnings**: Insights and techniques I discover in my day-to-day software engineering work  
- **Technical Deep Dives**: Exploring interesting problems and solutions
- **Building in Public**: My successes, failures, and everything in between

## The Tech Stack

I built this blog with simplicity in mind:

- **Next.js 15** with TypeScript for the framework
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling (with a warm, earthy color scheme)
- **Markdown files** for content (stored right in the repo)
- **Vercel** for hosting and deployment

## Why This Approach?

I could have used a fancy CMS or headless solution, but I wanted something:

1. **Simple** - just write markdown and push to git
2. **Fast** - static generation means instant loading
3. **Maintainable** - no external dependencies or APIs to break
4. **Version controlled** - my posts live alongside my code

## What's Coming Next

I'm currently working on some micro-SaaS ideas and will be documenting the process here:

- A developer-focused time tracking tool
- Some automation utilities I use daily
- Maybe a simple analytics dashboard for indie hackers

The goal isn't to build the next unicorn - it's to build useful tools, learn the process, and hopefully make a few hundred bucks a month while sharing what I learn.

## Let's Build Together

If you're also on the indie hacker journey or just love talking about code, I'd love to connect. This is just the beginning of documenting my journey in public.

Stay tuned for more posts about the technical details, business decisions, and everything in between!
